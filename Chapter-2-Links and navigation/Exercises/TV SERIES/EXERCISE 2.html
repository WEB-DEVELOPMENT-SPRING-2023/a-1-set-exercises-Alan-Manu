            <p>"Breaking Bad" is an American television drama series created by Vince Gilligan. 
                The show originally aired on AMC from 2008 to 2013, spanning five seasons and a total of
                 62 episodes. The series follows the story of Walter White, a struggling high school 
                 chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer and turns to cooking and selling 
                 methamphetamine with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, in order to provide for his family. <br>


                
                 The show has been highly acclaimed for its writing, acting, direction, and cinematography,
                 and has won numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. Bryan Cranston, who played 
                 Walter White, won four consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series,
                 and Aaron Paul, who played Jesse Pinkman, won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding 
                 Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. <br>
                
                In addition to its critical acclaim, "Breaking Bad" has also become a cultural phenomenon 
                and has been widely discussed and analyzed in popular culture. The show's popularity led 
                to the creation of a spin-off series, "Better Call Saul," which premiered in 2015 and 
                focuses on the character of Saul Goodman, played by Bob Odenkirk, who was a supporting 
                character in "Breaking Bad." <br>

            <p>1. Every action has reaction and sometimes you don't have any redeem for it, that exact 
                happened with Mr. White..I'd just finished the whole seasons of this unparalleled tv drama, 
                I would request u pls watch the whole seasons don't cut off till the last episode come.</p>
                                                                              
            <!-- p tag defines a paragraph here its being used to describe the reviews about breaking bad -->

            <p>2. Just loved it.
                I finished the whole series in just 5 days.
                The story was simple but the way they portrayed it was just just amazing.
                The level of acting done by every individual was brilliant and something that made the
                show even more watchable.
                I liked the characters each one of them.
                A chemist turned drug Lord under the eyes of his DEA brother-in-law seems so simple 
                of a story but the way the show proceeds was beautiful.</p>
