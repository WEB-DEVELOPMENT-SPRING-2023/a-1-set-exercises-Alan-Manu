    <!--ordered list of steps involed in recipe-->
    <ol>
        <li> Cook the rice in the milk: In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk, 
            rice, and salt to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer partially 
            covered until the rice is tender, about 20-25 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the 
            rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Mix the egg and sugar, temper with the hot cooked rice: 
            In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg and brown sugar until well 
            mixed. Add a half cup of the hot rice mixture to the egg mixture, 
            a tablespoon at a time, vigorously whisking to incorporate.</li>
                                                                                                           <!-- list of steps involved in the preparation of the dish -->
        <li>Add the egg mixture back to the pan: Add egg mixture back into the saucepan of rice and milk. 
            Reduce the heat to low and stir until thickened, or about 160°F (71°C).</li>
        <li>Be careful not to have the mixture come to a boil at this point or it will curdle. 
            Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, raisins, and cinnamon. 
            The pudding will thicken as it cools; when it is warm, it will be a bit on the runny side.
            Serve warm or cold.</li>    
    </ol>
